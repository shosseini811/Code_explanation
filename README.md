**Python Code Explanation with OpenAI API**

This repository contains a script that leverages OpenAI's API to automatically generate explanations for Python code from a GitHub repository. The script processes each line of code, obtains an explanation using the OpenAI's API, and appends the explanation as comments to a new output file. This can be an invaluable tool for developers looking to understand and document complex code, making projects more accessible to others.

**Features**

Imports and processes Python files from a GitHub repository
Generates explanations for each line of code using OpenAI's API
Saves the explained code as new files with explanations as comments
Supports recursive search for Python files in subdirectories
Prints progress messages to the console during processing

**Requirements**

Python 3.6 or higher
Libraries: os, glob, spacy, git, openai, dotenv, and BeautifulSoup

**Usage**

Set up your environment variables in a .env file with your OpenAI API key.
Modify the repo_url, main_file_path, repo_path, and output_base_path variables in the script to match your desired repository and local paths.
Run the script, which will clone the specified GitHub repository, process each Python file, and generate explanations for each line of code.
The script will create new files with '_explained.py' appended to the original file names, containing the original code and explanations as comments.
